# DeHazifyingAlgorithm-VisionEnhancer

### Problem Statement: 
- Design and development of a surveillance device to increase the visibility of an indoor public area under fire.
- The Device will help the rescue team in proper decision-making.

### The Proposed Solution:
- The Device comprises a camera, a processor, and a display device.
- It is an edge computing device, which takes real-time surveillance video stream as input and produces respective output video with increased visibility.
- The Device is hardware equipped with an Al-ML-based intelligent de-smoking/de-hazing algorithm.

### Novelties of The Device:
- The Device will be capable of improving visibility in the indoor smoke video.
- The processing speed of GARUDA is fast enough to process input video in real-time.
- Visual quality of the smoke video can be improved using control C, provided in GARUDA. This control will improve the visual quality obtained by GARUDA at the cost of processing speed. 
The user can utilize the control to maintain a trade-off between visual quality and processing speed.

### Show Stoppers:
- Real-time indoor smoked video enhancement.
- Red Alert Live Notifications sent on the DeHazify App.
- Fire Alarm Linkage.
- Quality and Statistic control parameters.

### Use Cases:
- Location-based remote access.
- Access to Multiple Locations.
- May be able to show the current temp and other stats
- Provision of notification alerts in case of abnormal temperature rise.

### Applications:
- Can be used in Homes, Schools, Factories, Large Scale MNCs, Hospitals, Cinema Halls, and Closed Campuses.
